## Intro
We can use this project as the foundation for our capstone. We will build off of this using Asp.net Core backend and an Angular front end. Both client and server code are in the same project to keep things as simple as possible. We will use our skills to build MVC controllers to provide the data to our front end Angular web app. The data will be stored using Entity Framework with SQL, and the database will be built with EF data migrations. To interact with the data, we will build Angular components to provide the functionality of being able to view and create data through a web browser.
